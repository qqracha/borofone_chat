# CI/CD Deployment

## Overview

Production and staging run in Docker Compose only.
The API is no longer started by systemd services during normal deploys.

Environment mapping:

- `main` -> production
- `dev` -> staging

Persistent runtime data lives outside the git checkout:

- production: `/var/lib/borofone/production`
- staging: `/var/lib/borofone/staging`
- backups: `/var/backups/borofone`

Each environment must define:

- `HOST_DATA_ROOT`
- `BACKUP_ROOT`

## Deploy flow

GitHub Actions connects over SSH and runs:

```bash
bash deploy/scripts/deploy-stack.sh production
```

or:

```bash
bash deploy/scripts/deploy-stack.sh staging
```

The deploy script performs:

1. git sync for the target branch
2. backup of database, uploads, leaderboard, and `.env`
3. one-time migration of legacy uploads volume and repo-local leaderboard files into host storage
4. `docker compose config` preflight validation
5. startup and health checks for Postgres and Redis
6. API image build
7. Alembic migrations
8. API recreation and health verification

## First rollout / cutover

On the first rollout after introducing this flow:

1. Ensure `.env` exists in `/opt/borofone-chat-prod` and `/opt/borofone-chat-staging`.
2. Set `HOST_DATA_ROOT` and `BACKUP_ROOT` to absolute host paths.
3. Run the deploy once.

During the first deploy, `prepare-persistent-data.sh` will:

- create host-backed directories for uploads and leaderboard
- migrate uploads from the legacy Docker volume if the new target is empty
- migrate repo-local leaderboard files if the new target is empty
- write a migration marker file under `HOST_DATA_ROOT`
- stop, disable, and mask legacy `borofone-prod` / `borofone-staging` systemd units if present

Legacy Docker volumes are kept in place for rollback safety.

## Operational notes

- Do not use `docker compose down` for normal application updates.
- Do not store runtime user files inside the repository checkout.
- Use `docker compose` instead of legacy `docker-compose`.
- Reverse proxy remains in nginx and continues to target `127.0.0.1:8000` and `127.0.0.1:8001`.
